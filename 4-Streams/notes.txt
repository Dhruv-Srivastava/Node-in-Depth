1) Streams are an abstract interface to work with streaming data in Node JS.

2) Streaming data? Streaming data -> Continuous flow of data.

3) The basic premise of streams is that instead of sending/receiving data in one go (as a whole), we can send/receive data in chunks. This somehow makes the whole process faster* and more memory efficient.

4) There are two fundamental types of stream, 'write' and 'read' streams and two more modified version of the fundamental, 'duplex' and 'transform'.

5) The write and read stream object has ONE buffer with a maximum capacity of 16 KB often called as high watermark. However, both duplex and transform stream object has TWO buffers, one for writing and another for reading.

6) One must always write to the write stream buffer when the buffer becomes empty. If you keep writing to the buffer and won't let the buffer to drain/empty, then you are going to cause memory issues.
