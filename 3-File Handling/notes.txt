1. A file is just a squence of bits. These sequence of bits could mean different things depending upon the decoding used.

Eg: Let's say this file has bits like 1000011100101. This sequence could correspond to some characters or some image or an audio or anything. 


2. Node JS interacts with the files stored in the storage devices through the OS via system calls (study later).


3. Function used to open a file in Node -> Node -> libuv -> open() system call to the OS.


4. There are various ways to deal with file in Node. You can deal a file using the Promise API way or by callback API way or just synchronously.


5. Time to read this file using Promise API: 11-14
   Time to read this file using Callback API: 12-14
   Time to read this file synchronously: 12-14

   However, dealing with files synchronously will block the thread of execution


6. A file descriptor is a unique number assigned to a file when it is opened.
